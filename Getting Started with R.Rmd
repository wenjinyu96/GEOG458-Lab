# Hello!
## How are you today?
### It's so nice to see you. :)

This is *wenjinyu96*'s first assignment for **Geog458**. Our course page can be accessed [here](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1269928).

![This is my college](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2014/09/07214435/Signature_Stacked_Purple_Hex.png)


I have this homework question. Can you solve this integral for me?  $$\int r\left ( 1-\frac{2N}{k} \right )rN\left ( 1-\frac{N}{k} \right )$$

Oh, you don't know how to solve this either?
Let me think who can we call later...

   Name| Number
-------|--------------
  Jacob| 123-456-7890
   Gaby| 234-567-8901
William| 345-678-9012 
Reference:The Contact


None of them answers my call. It's ok. I'll move on to the next assignment.


```{r}
data(swiss)
str(swiss)
summary(swiss)
plot(swiss$Fertility,
main="Swiss",
xlab="Years After",
ylab="Fertility Rate",
type="l",
col="blue")
```

#### -Task6

100/10+2 = `r 100/10+2`

100/(10+2) = `r 100/(10+2)`

10/3+5-2 = `r 10/3+5-2`

45*36/36-20 = `r 45*36/36-20`

45*36/(36-20) = `r 45*36/(36-20)`

(70*36+24-56/2)^3 = `r (70*36+24-56/2)^3`

(70*(36+24-56)/2)^3 = `r (70*(36+24-56)/2)^3`

#### -Task 7
```{r task7}
x = 8 * 3
cat(("x = ") ,x,"\n")
cat(("x + 10 = ") ,x+10,"\n")

y = 2 * 15
z = 9
cat("y = ", y,"\n")
cat("z = ", z,"\n")
cat("y + z^3 = ", (y + z^3) ,"\n")
cat("x + 3 * y - 4 = ", (x + 3 * y - 4),"\n")
cat("x * 2 + y * (5 + y - z) = ", (x * 2 + y * (5 + y - z)))
```
#### -Task 8
```{r task8}
myT8vec = seq(from = 1, to = 30, by = 1)
stringV = c("name1","name2","name3")
cat("length of the vector",length(myT8vec),"\n")
cat("length of c = ", length(c),"\n")
cat("my vector is: ",sum(myT8vec),"\n")
cat("sum(stringV) will popout","Error in sum(stringV) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument" )
```
#### -Task 9
```{r task9}
t9vec_1 = seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)
t9vec_2 = seq(from = 6, to = 10, by = 1)
t9vec_sum = t9vec_1+t9vec_2
cat("1st vector = ", t9vec_1,"\n","2nd vector = ",t9vec_2,"\n")
cat("the sum of two vectors is ",t9vec_sum,"\n")
t9vec_3 = seq(from = 11, to = 15, by = 1)
t9vec_multi = t9vec_1 * t9vec_3
cat("3rd vector = ",t9vec_3,"\n","product of 1st and 3rd is ", t9vec_multi )
```

#### -Task 10
```{r task10}
newVec = c(t9vec_1,t9vec_2)
newVec
matrix_10 = rbind(t9vec_1,t9vec_2,t9vec_multi)
matrix_10
```

## Loading the Data

This is how to load data into R and how to convert it.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r fetchcsv}
library(tidyverse)
object1 = read.csv("China_EO_49to17.csv" ,fileEncoding="latin1")
object2 = as_tibble(object1)
datC=object2
datC$Year=seq(from=1949, to=2017)
datC=datC[order(-datC$Year),]
head(datC)
datC_S = filter(datC[c(1,2,3,18,19)],datC[c(1,2,3,18,19)]$Year>1999)
datC_S=mutate(datC_S,Output_Ratio=datC_S$Beijing_Output/datC_S$Shanghai_Output)
datC_S
```
